# 🚀 IMPORTANT: Database Setup Required

## Your Backend is Almost Ready!

✅ **Environment variables** are configured  
✅ **Code integration** is complete  
✅ **Authentication UI** is ready  
⏳ **Database migration** needs to be run

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL STEP: Run Database Migration

Before you can test the app, you MUST run the database migration in Supabase.

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

#### 1. Open Your Supabase Dashboard
Go to: **https://mirpnmrsjjmmiqbbawab.supabase.co**

#### 2. Navigate to SQL Editor
- Click **"SQL Editor"** in the left sidebar
- Click **"New Query"** button

#### 3. Copy the Migration SQL
- Open the file: `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`
- Select ALL contents (it's a large file - about 300+ lines)
- Copy everything

#### 4. Paste and Run
- Paste the SQL into the Supabase SQL Editor
- Click **"RUN"** (or press Ctrl/Cmd + Enter)
- Wait for it to complete (should take 3-5 seconds)

#### 5. Verify Success
You should see: **"Success. No rows returned"**

Then go to **Table Editor** (left sidebar) and verify these 6 tables exist:
- ✅ profiles
- ✅ Resolves
- ✅ milestones
- ✅ reminders
- ✅ achievements
- ✅ activity_log

## ✨ What Happens After?

Once the migration is complete, your app will have:

### 🗄️ Database
- 6 tables with proper relationships
- Row Level Security enabled
- Automatic triggers for timestamps
- Progress auto-calculation
- Optimized indexes

### 🔐 Authentication
- Full user sign up/sign in
- Profile auto-creation
- Session management

### 📊 Features
- Resolve creation and tracking
- Milestone management
- Progress calculation
- Reminder settings
- Achievement system
- Activity logging

---

## 🧪 Testing After Setup

### 1. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Authentication
1. App will show Welcome screen
2. Click "Get Started"
3. Sign up with a test account:
   - Email: test@example.com
   - Password: test123456
   - Name: Test User

### 3. Verify in Supabase
After signing up, check Supabase dashboard:
- Go to **Authentication** → **Users**
- You should see your new user!
- Go to **Table Editor** → **profiles**
- Your profile should be automatically created!

### 4. Create a Test Resolve
1. Complete the onboarding flow
2. Create a Resolve with a few milestones
3. Go to Supabase **Table Editor** → **Resolves**
4. You should see your Resolve!
5. Check **milestones** table too

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: SQL migration fails
**Solution:** 
- Make sure you copied the ENTIRE file
- Check for any error messages in Supabase
- The file starts with `-- Enable UUID extension`
- The file ends with trigger definitions

### Issue: "Missing Supabase environment variables"
**Solution:** 
- `.env.local` should exist in your project root
- Restart your dev server: Stop (Ctrl+C) and run `npm run dev` again

### Issue: Tables not showing up
**Solution:**
- Migration didn't run successfully
- Re-run the migration SQL
- Check Supabase logs for errors

### Issue: Can't sign up
**Solution:**
- Database migration must be run first
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Supabase URL and keys in `.env.local`
