## 📱 **Push Notifications Features**

### Daily Reminders
- Set a specific time (e.g., 9:00 AM)
- Notification fires every day at that time
- "🎯 Resolve Reminder: Time to work on [Resolve Name]"

### Weekly Reminders  
- Choose specific days of the week
- Set time for each day
- Only notifies on selected days

### Custom Reminders
- Pick any combination of days (Mon, Tue, Wed, etc.)
- Different time for each selected day
- Maximum flexibility

### Celebration Notifications
- 🎉 When you complete a milestone
- 🏆 When you complete a Resolve (100% progress)
- Sent immediately

---

## 🎯 **How It Works**

### When User Creates a Resolve:
1. User goes through category → naming → milestones → **reminders**
2. In ReminderSetup, user selects frequency and time
3. App requests notification permission
4. Reminder scheduled locally on device
5. Reminder settings saved to Supabase database
6. Resolve created with all data

### When User Completes Milestone:
1. User taps checkbox on milestone
2. App calls `MilestoneService.toggleMilestone()`
3. Backend updates milestone.completed = true
4. **Trigger fires** → Resolve progress auto-updates
5. Achievement check runs
6. 🎉 Celebration notification sent
7. Activity logged
8. Dashboard refreshes with new data

### When Reminder Fires:
1. Device shows notification at scheduled time
2. User taps notification
3. App opens to that specific Resolve
4. User can update progress

---

## 🧪 **Testing Guide**

### Test 1: Real Data Loading
```bash
1. Restart app: npm run dev
2. Sign in with existing account
3. Dashboard should show Resolves from database
4. Click on a Resolve → see real milestones
5. Progress bars show actual data from backend
```

**Expected:** All data loads from Supabase, no mock data

---

### Test 2: Milestone Completion with Notifications
```bash
1. Go to dashboard
2. Click on any Resolve
3. Tap checkbox on a milestone
4. See confetti animation
5. Check notification appears: "🎉 Milestone Completed!"
6. Go to Supabase → milestones table
7. Verify milestone.completed = true
8. Go to Supabase → Resolves table
9. Verify progress updated automatically
```

**Expected:** 
- ✅ Milestone marked complete in database
- ✅ Progress auto-updates
- ✅ Notification sent
- ✅ Activity logged

---

### Test 3: Create Resolve with Reminders
```bash
1. Click "+ New Resolve"
2. Go through flow: category → naming → milestones
3. At reminder screen:
   - Toggle "Enable Reminders" ON
   - Select "Daily"
   - Choose "Morning" (8:00 AM)
4. Complete setup
5. Device asks for notification permission → Allow
6. Check Supabase → reminders table
7. Verify reminder saved with:
   - frequency = 'daily'
   - time = '08:00'
   - enabled = true
```

**Expected:**
- ✅ Permission requested
- ✅ Reminder scheduled on device
- ✅ Reminder data saved to database

---

### Test 4: Daily Reminder Fires
```bash
Option A - Wait for scheduled time
Option B - Test immediately:
1. In ReminderSetup, set time to 1 minute from now
2. Complete Resolve setup
3. Wait 1 minute
4. Notification appears!
```

**Expected:**
- ✅ Notification shows at scheduled time
- ✅ Title: "🎯 Resolve Reminder"
- ✅ Body: "Time to work on: [Resolve Name]"

---

### Test 5: Custom Day Reminders
```bash
1. Create new Resolve
2. At reminder screen:
   - Select "Custom"
   - Choose Mon, Wed, Fri
   - Set time to 2:00 PM
3. Complete setup
4. Check notifications scheduled for those specific days
```

**Expected:**
- ✅ 3 separate notifications scheduled
- ✅ Only fire on Mon, Wed, Fri at 2 PM

---

## 🔧 **Configuration**

### Notification Permissions
Required for push notifications to work:
- **iOS:** App requests permission automatically
- **Android:** Granted by default
- **Web:** Browser notification API (limited support)

### Testing on Physical Device
⚠️ **Important:** Push notifications only work on **physical devices**, not simulators/emulators!

To test:
1. Build development app: `npx expo run:android` or `npx expo run:ios`
2. Install on your phone
3. Test notifications

---

## 📊 **Database Schema for Reminders**

Your `reminders` table stores:
```sql
{
  id: UUID,
  pakt_id: UUID,           -- Links to Resolve
  user_id: UUID,           -- Links to user
  frequency: 'daily' | 'weekly' | 'custom',
  time: '09:00',           -- HH:MM format
  days: ['Mon', 'Wed'],    -- For custom frequency
  enabled: true,           -- Can toggle on/off
  created_at: timestamp,
  updated_at: timestamp
}
```

---

## 🎨 **What's Different Now**

### Before (Mock Data):
```typescript
const currentStreak = 7; // Hardcoded
const Resolves = [...]; // Local state
// Data lost on refresh
```

### After (Real Backend):
```typescript
const { Resolves, loading } = usePakts(); // From database
const { milestones, toggleMilestone } = useMilestones(paktId);
// Data persists forever
// Progress auto-calculates
// Notifications scheduled
```

---

## 🚀 **Production Deployment**

To deploy with push notifications:

### 1. Configure Expo Project
```json
// app.json
{
  "expo": {
    "notification": {
      "icon": "./assets/notification-icon.png",
      "color": "#9163F2"
    },
    "ios": {
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.yourcompany.paktiq"
    },
    "android": {
      "package": "com.yourcompany.paktiq",
      "permissions": [
        "RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED",
        "SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Build Production App
```bash
# For Android
npx expo build:android

# For iOS
npx expo build:ios
```

### 3. Test on Device
```bash
# Development build
npx expo run:android --device
npx expo run:ios --device
```

## 📱 **Notification Behavior**

### When App is Open (Foreground):
- Notification shows as in-app alert
- User can dismiss or tap to view Resolve

### When App is Closed (Background):
- Notification shows in system tray
- Tap opens app to specific Resolve

### When Device is Locked:
- Notification shows on lock screen
- Sound/vibration alert user

---

## 🔍 **Debugging Notifications**

### Check Scheduled Notifications:
```typescript
import { NotificationService } from './services';

// Get all scheduled
const scheduled = await NotificationService.getAllScheduledNotifications();
console.log(scheduled);
```

### Cancel All Notifications:
```typescript
await NotificationService.cancelAllNotifications();
```

### Test Immediate Notification:
```typescript
await NotificationService.sendImmediateNotification(
  'Test Title',
  'Test Body',
  { test: true }
);
```
