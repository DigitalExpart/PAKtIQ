# 🎯 Test Your Sign-Up Screen Now!

## ✅ **FIXED ISSUE**

**Problem:** AuthScreen wasn't showing because `'auth'` wasn't in the Screen type  
**Solution:** Added `'auth'` to `src/types.ts` Screen type  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Ready to test!

---

## 🚀 **How to Test Sign-Up/Login Flow**

### **Step 1: Start Your App**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173` (or your dev URL)

---

### **Step 2: Welcome Screen → Sign Up**

1. **You'll see the Welcome Screen** with:
   - "Get Started" button
   - "Explore" button

2. **Click either button** → Takes you to **AuthScreen**

---

### **Step 3: Create Account**

On the AuthScreen:

1. **Enter your email:** `test@example.com`
2. **Enter your password:** `Test1234!`
3. **Click "Sign Up"**

**What happens:**
- ✅ Creates user in Supabase Auth
- ✅ Auto-creates profile in `profiles` table (via trigger)
- ✅ Redirects to Onboarding or Dashboard

---

### **Step 4: Verify in Supabase**

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Click **Authentication** → **Users**
3. You should see your new user!
4. Click **Table Editor** → **profiles**
5. You should see your profile with:
   - Your email
   - `onboarding_completed = false`
   - `dark_mode = false`
   - `notification_preferences` (default JSON)

---

### **Step 5: Test Login**

1. **Refresh your app** (or open in incognito)
2. Click "Get Started" → Goes to AuthScreen
3. **Toggle to "Sign In" mode** (if there's a toggle)
4. Enter same email/password
5. Click "Sign In"
6. Should see Dashboard (since onboarding is now completed)

---

## 🎨 **What the AuthScreen Looks Like**

The `AuthScreen.tsx` component has:

- **Beautiful gradient background** (purple/blue)
- **Email input field**
- **Password input field**
- **Sign Up button** (or Sign In toggle)
- **Loading states**
- **Error messages** (if something goes wrong)

---

## ⚠️ **Common Issues & Fixes**

### **Issue: "Can't find AuthScreen"**
✅ **Fixed!** Added `'auth'` to Screen type in `src/types.ts`

### **Issue: "Sign up fails"**
Check:
- Is `.env.local` set up with correct Supabase keys?
- Did you run the database migration?
- Check browser console for errors

### **Issue: "Stuck on loading"**
Check:
- Browser console for auth errors
- Network tab to see if Supabase requests are working
- Make sure Supabase project is awake (free tier sleeps after inactivity)

### **Issue: "Profile not created"**
Check:
- Supabase → **Database** → **Triggers**
- Should see `on_auth_user_created` trigger
- If missing, re-run migration `001_initial_schema.sql`
