VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Im1pcnBubXJzamptbWlxYmJhd2FiIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NjQ3MjQ5NDcsImV4cCI6MjA4MDMwMDk0N30.0INXVgxZsdjsD0DL8Ot_Q3RfYPqwBwz5O1_E6Lu4q9g

## 🔥 Pro Tips

1. **Use hooks everywhere** - They handle caching and state
2. **Wrap app with AuthProvider** - Required for authentication
3. **Check the examples** - See `src/App.example.tsx`
4. **Read type definitions** - IntelliSense will help you
5. **Test with real data** - Create a test account first

---

## ⚡ Quick Integration Example

```tsx
// 1. Wrap your app
import { AuthProvider } from './contexts/AuthContext';

function App() {
  return (
    <AuthProvider>
      <YourApp />
    </AuthProvider>
  );
}

// 2. Use in components
import { useAuth } from './contexts/AuthContext';
import { usePakts } from './hooks';

function Dashboard() {
  const { user } = useAuth();
  const { Resolves, loading } = usePakts();
  
  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (!user) return <div>Please sign in</div>;
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome {user.email}!</h1>
      <p>You have {Resolves.length} Resolves</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

That's it! Your backend is working!
