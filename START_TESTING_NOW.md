## ⚠️ **KNOWN ISSUES (Minor)**

### 1. Templates Not in Database

- **Impact:** Can't save custom templates
- **Workaround:** Use provided templates (works fine)
- **Fix Later:** Add `pakt_templates` table if needed

### 2. No Premium Payment
- **What:** Premium UI exists but no Stripe/payment
- **Impact:** Can't actually upgrade to premium
- **Workaround:** Manually set `profiles.premium = true` in DB
- **Fix Later:** Add payment integration when monetizing

### 3. No Profile Edit Screen
- **What:** Can't edit name/avatar in UI
- **Impact:** Stuck with signup name/avatar
- **Workaround:** Manually edit `profiles` table in Supabase
