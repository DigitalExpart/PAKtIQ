## 🚨 ONE CRITICAL STEP REMAINING

### Run the Database Migration

**This is REQUIRED before you can use the app!**

👉 **Follow the guide:** `DATABASE_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

**Quick Summary:**
1. Go to: https://mirpnmrsjjmmiqbbawab.supabase.co
2. SQL Editor → New Query
3. Copy all of `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`
4. Paste and RUN
5. Verify 6 tables created

**Time needed:** 2 minutes

---

## 🧪 Testing Your Backend (After Migration)

### 1. Start the App
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Open Browser
Navigate to your local dev server (usually `http://localhost:5173`)

### 3. Create Test Account
- Click "Get Started"
- Click "Sign Up"
- Enter:
  - Name: Test User
  - Email: test@example.com
  - Password: test123456
- Click "Create Account"

### 4. Verify in Supabase
Go to Supabase Dashboard:
- **Authentication → Users**: See your new user
- **Table Editor → profiles**: Profile auto-created!

### 5. Create Test Pakt
- Complete onboarding
- Select category (e.g., "Fitness")
- Name: "Test Pakt"
- Description: "Testing the backend"
- Add 2-3 milestones
- Complete the flow

### 6. Verify in Database
Go to Supabase Dashboard:
- **Table Editor → pakts**: See your pakt!
- **Table Editor → milestones**: See your milestones!

## 🎯 Workflow After Migration

### User Flow
```
Welcome Screen
    ↓
Sign Up / Sign In  ← Authentication via Supabase
    ↓
Onboarding Flow
    ↓
Category Selection
    ↓
Pakt Creation     ← Saves to database

## 🔥 Cool Features You Have Now

### 1. Automatic Profile Creation
When user signs up → Profile automatically created in database

### 2. Auto Progress Tracking
Mark milestone complete → Pakt progress updates automatically

### 3. Real-time Data
All pakts/milestones from database → Always in sync

### 4. Secure by Default
Row Level Security → Users only see their own data

### 5. Type-Safe Operations
TypeScript types → Catch errors before runtime

## 📊 Your Database Structure

```
profiles (user accounts)
   ↓
pakts (commitments)
   ├── milestones (sub-goals)
   ├── reminders (notifications)
   └── activity_log (history)
   ↓
achievements (badges)
```

**Tables:** 6  
**Relationships:** Properly linked  
**Security:** RLS enabled on all tables  
**Triggers:** Auto-update timestamps & progress

## 🎨 What Your Users Will Experience

### Before (Old Way)
- Data stored in local state
- Lost on page refresh
- No persistence
- No user accounts

### After (With Backend) ✨
- Data saved to cloud database
- Persists across devices
- User authentication
- Profile management
- Progress tracking
- Achievement system

## 💡 Quick Tips

### Tip 1: Check Supabase Dashboard
Your best friend for debugging! See data in real-time.

### Tip 2: Read Service Code
`src/services/` files show you how to use the backend.

### Tip 3: Use Hooks
```tsx
const { pakts, loading, createPakt } = usePakts();
```
Hooks handle everything automatically!

### Tip 4: Trust the Types
TypeScript will guide you:
```tsx
createPakt({
  user_id: '',     // ← IntelliSense shows required fields
  name: '',
  // ... TypeScript helps you
})
```

### Tip 5: Check Browser Console
Errors and auth events show up there.

## 🐛 Common Issues

### "Missing environment variables"
**Fix:** Restart dev server after creating `.env.local`

### "relation does not exist"
**Fix:** Database migration not run yet. Run it!

### "Row Level Security violation"
**Fix:** User not authenticated. Check login.

### Tables not in Supabase
**Fix:** Migration didn't run. Try again.
